# Número de threads
No enunciado completo era questionado o número de threads, por que n(n-1)/2 em vez de (n^2). Isso se dá pelo fato de que n^2 iria repetir as comparações, enquanto a primeira formula prevê a comparação entre dois numeros apenas 1 vez.

# Questões de ánalise
Executando o programa q2, que usa threads temos a seguinte sequência (gerada usando $seq 50, modificando o numero 25 para 100) no console:

A principio pensamos que por usar de threads o programa naturalmente irá executar mais rápido, porém se pensarmos na quantidade de threads que foram criadas e que isso também é custoso para o sistema, nasce a hipótese que a diferença de discrepante de 10x no programa que usa thread se dá por isso. Para provarmos essa hipotese foi criado um novo programa que aloca menos threads, diferente do primeiro, esse irá alocar uma quantidade de (n-1) threads, tal que cada thread compare um número da sequência com todos os outros. Esse executável se chama q2op(question 2 optimized) e sua execução gerou:

```shell

O tempo reduziu! Ainda que q2wt seja menor, a diferença de execução com q2 foi menor que 4x. Portanto, apesar de threads paralelizar a execução do código, uma otimização é usar de uma quantidade menor de threads, afim de mensurar quando o tempo de criação de threads otimiza a execução.
